# Javascript-
This repository tracks my journey of learning JavaScript from Chai aur Code by Hitesh Choudhary. I upload daily practice code, notes, and examples from each class to build strong fundamentals. The goal is to stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills, and document my progress publicly while mastering core JavaScript concepts step by step.
